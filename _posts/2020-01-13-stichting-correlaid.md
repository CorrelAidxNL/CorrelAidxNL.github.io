On the 13th of January 2020 Stichting Correlaid Nederland was founded by Fabian Dablander, Andrew Sutjahjo, and Yiran Guo. This marks an important milestone for us.

After 1.5 years it is time to professionalize our Dutch offshoot of CorrelAid to further our aims in the Netherlands. Weâ€™ve grown up, and our German mother organization now becomes our sister organization.

Full of energy, we are looking forward to new events, continued collaboration with our German counterpart, and working hard on growing a network of data scientists dedicated to helping organisations that advance the social good.
