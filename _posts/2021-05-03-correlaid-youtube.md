We have recently started to host regular events, with topics ranging from using data science to address vaccine misinformation and ethical AI for humanitarian aid to machine learning for depression and open geo-data for resilience.

One of the accidental gifts of the coronavirus pandemic is that these events are taking place online, which means they can easily be recorded for those who could not attend. We have now created a [CorrelAid Netherlands YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRBedMwdhH9kWFf3tOmekWw) which makes past and future recordings of our events available.
