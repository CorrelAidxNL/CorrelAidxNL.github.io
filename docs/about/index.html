    <p>CorrelAid Netherlands is a non-profit organization that connects data scientists with organizations that do good. 
  We have a network of over 300 data scientists in the Netherlands and over 1500 abroad that are eager to volunteer 
  their time and expertise to help non-profits with their data challenges. We started in 2018 as the Dutch chapter of 
  <a href="https://correlaid.org/">CorrelAid</a>. In 2020, Andrew, Fabian, and Yiran <a href="/blog/stichting-correlaid">
    officially founded</a> the Stichting CorrelAid Nederland.
  </p>
  
  <p>Our core activity is to engage in 3-6 month long projects where a team of our data scientists works with an organization 
    pro bono. We have completed a number of <b><a href="/projects">projects</a></b> successfully since our inception. We also organize 
    <b><a href="https://www.meetup.com/correlaid-netherlands/">events</a></b> such as hackathons and meetups.</p>
  <h1>Goals</h1> 
  <p>Our goals are three-fold:</p>
  <p> 1. To create impact by working with non-profit organizations, utilizing the power of data and data science to further their societal contribution. 
    We are providing a high-quality volunteer data science workforce and aim to become a well-known part of the Dutch non-profit ecosystem.
  </p>
  <p>2. To empower the non-profit sector to work with their own data. Systematically relying on skilled volunteers for data challenges is 
    not sustainable. The projects give organizations a taste of what is possible with data and give us an opportunity to facilitate the 
    continuation of the organization’s data journey after the project is done.
  </p>
  <p> 3. To create a diverse community of data scientists in the Netherlands who want to use their skills to advance the social good. 
    We want to create a platform where collaborations can emerge organically, and where our volunteers can learn from each other and help each other.
  </p>

  <p>Are you an NGO that is interested in what we have to offer? 
  Then head over <a href="/getinvolved">here</a> and get in touch! Are you a data scientist interested in applying your skills 
  and joining our community? Then head over <a href="/getinvolved">here</a> and have a chat with us! Do you want to see what events we have coming up?

  <h1>Core Team</h1>

  <h3>Mehrzad Karami | NPO Engagement</h3>
  <img src="/images/mehrzad.jpg" style="float: left; width: 220px; height: 200px; padding-right: 20px;">
  <p>Mehrzad received his Masters in Artificial Intelligence back in the time when AI was not that common in The Netherlands.
    As part of the first groups of students who did a full AI study in the Netherlands, he joined the early adopters of AI
    and took the challenge of bringing practical AI to the endeavors of everyday life. He has currently taken the challenge of
    bringing the power of collaboration to the scientific world by building digital solutions based on AI and Data Science.
    Mehrzad joined CorrelAid with the goal of making this blue planet a better place for everyone, helping NGOs harness the power of Data
    and Data Science. With a strong passion for collaboration and people, Mehrzad's everyday reminder is: Live, Love, Explore,
    and challenge your excuses everyday! <br>Contact: <a href="mailto:mehrzad@correlaid.nl">mehrzad@correlaid.nl</a>,

  <h3>Alexis Gillett | All-Round Fixer </h3>
  <img src="/images/alexis.jpg" style="float: left; width: 220px; height: 200px; padding-right: 20px;">
  <p>Alexis got involved with CorrelAid as way to put his existing data (science) and management skills to a positive use.
    He originally moved to the Netherlands for a PhD in Probability Theory and has since had a somewhat nomadic career encompassing energy,
    finance, management, consulting and, of course, data science. He is particularly keen on evidence-based decision making and
    how the right perspective and information can reduce complex problems to straightforward ones.

  <h3>Maria Bader | Technical Lead</h3>
  <img src="/images/maria_bader.jpg" style="float: left; width: 220px; height: 200px; padding-right: 20px;">
  <p>Maria got involved with CorrelAid because she wants to make a meaningful impact with her data skills.
    She discovered her love for unraveling hidden details in data during her career as a Physicist,
    which has equipped her with the unique ability to approach complex problems with a scientific mindset.
    In her day job, she works in the role of Data Scientist, who is specialised in both traditional machine learning and generative AI techniques.

  <h3>Selin Topel | NPO Engagement</h3>
  <img src="/images/selin.jpg" style="float: left; width: 220px; height: 200px; padding-right: 20px;">
  <p>Selin joined CorrelAid Nederland because it brings two of her favorite things together: working with data, and volunteering for organization whose
    efforts advance social good. Selin did her bachelor's in psychology with a minor in business in Turkey where she is originally from.
    She is currently working as a PhD researcher at the Institute of Psychology at Leiden University, where she investigates how people
    learn and make decisions under uncertainty by modelling human behavior and brain responses. While she was volunteering for non-profit
    organizations before the pandemic, after the start of the pandemic she decided to put her skills she gained through her
    research training to use as a volunteer. As a part of CorrelAid team, she aims to contribute to organizing events for the CorrelAid Nederland
    community and help expand the reach of the organization.

  <img src="/images/MirjamQuaak.jpg" style="float: left; width: 220px; height: 200px; padding-right: 20px;">
  <p>Mirjam discovered CorrelAid while searching for ways to make a positive impact with her

  <h3> Winnie | Team</h3>
  <img src="/images/winnie.jpg" style="float: left; width: 220px; height: 200px; padding-right: 20px;">
  <p> Winnie has been with CorrelAid as a volunteer for approximately 2 years.
    After her Masters in financial econometrics she’s had a somewhat rocky journey but her love for data, models and analyses has always been a constant.
    As a lover of all things data, programming and tech and wanting to contribute to a better world,
    she tried to find an opportunity to help others using a quantitative
    approach. Sharing her love for data and tech, correlaid seemed like the perfect opportunity.
    Winnie is currently working on integration of Salesforce and helping Anastasiia and Alexis with blog posts for our website and the structure of our website.
    Having met wonderful people who are inclusive and kind during her time at CorrelAid,
    Winnie cannot encourage people enough to join CorrelAid and hope many more people will sign up.

  <h3> Andrew Sutjahjo | Chairman</h3>
  <img src="/images/andrew.jpg" style="float: left; width: 220px; height: 200px; padding-right: 20px;">
  <p>During his masters in Neuroscience, Andrew started up an NGO and tried to build an orphanage in Kenya.
    Two years in, he failed and vowed to build up his skillset and network to try to do good again once he had more experience.
    He has since then worked as a data scientist at Capgemini, United Wardrobe, and Utelly, specializing in NLP, Search, and Recommendation Systems.
    After seeing how much more impact we can have with data, he’s switched from building orphanages to building models for good.
