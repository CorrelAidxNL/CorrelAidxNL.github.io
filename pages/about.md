In 2018, the Dutch chapter of CorrelAid started with a small number of people excited to use their data skills to advance the social good. In 2020, Andrew, Fabian, and Yiran officially founded the Stichting CorrelAid Nederland.

Together with a dedicated and hard working core team, they are busy building a network of data scientists and data enthusiasts across the Netherlands that are eager to help organizations that advance the social good.

Our core goals are three-fold:

1. Help organizations that advance the social good, pro-bono.
2. Train data scientists and data enthusiasts through working on real problems.
3. Create a thriving community of data scientists in the Netherlands.

## Core Team

### Andrew Sutjahjo | Chairman
During his masters in Neuroscience, Andrew started up an NGO and tried to build an orphanage in Kenya. Two years in, he failed and vowed to build up his skillset and network to try to do good again once he had more experience. He has since then worked as a data scientist at Capgemini, United Wardrobe, and Utelly, specializing in NLP, Search, and Recommendation Systems. After seeing how much more impact we can have with data, he’s switched from building orphanages to building models for good. You can hear Andrew's story and learn about the type of work we do at CorrelAid Nederland [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_CLmbsmCYQ). 


### Fabian Dablander | Secretary
Fabian received his Masters degree in Cognitive Science from the University of Tübingen, Germany, and is currently doing his PhD at Department of Psychological Methods at the University of Amsterdam. He works on topics related to Bayesian inference and testing, causal inference, and dynamical systems modeling. Besides academic things, he is excited about initiatives that use data for the social good. You can find him on Twitter and on his website.

### Mehrzad Karami | NPO Engagement
 Mehrzad received his Masters in Artificial Intelligence back in the time when AI was not that common in The Netherlands. As part of the first groups of students who did a full AI study in the Netherlands, he joined the early adopters of AI and took the challenge of bringing practical AI to the endeavors of everyday life. He has currently taken the challenge of bringing the power of collaboration to the scientific world by building digital solutions based on AI and Data Science. Mehrzad joined CorrelAid with the goal of making this blue planet a better place for everyone, helping NGOs harness the power of Data and Data Science. With a strong passion for collaboration and people, Mehrzad's everyday reminder is: Live, Love, Explore, and challenge your excuses everyday!
