### As a volunteer
Do you want to apply your data science skills to a real world problem? Then CorrelAid Netherlands is for you! In teams of usually 1-4 people, we help NGOs gain insight into their own data and use the results. We announce projects on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CorrelAidxNL), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CorrelAidXNetherlands), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/correlaid-x-netherlands/), through our [Newsletter](https://correlaid.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=b294bf2834adf5d89bdd2dd5a&id=915f3f3eff), and on Slack, so be sure to follow us there. If you want to join our community on Slack, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/Y8E3jsW2FBmCfq9h7). Afterwards, we will contact you to have a chat and invite you. For further details, please contact Andrew.

Are you working on an interesting data project already and want to share your results with a wide audience? Is your organisation using data in innovative ways to tackle difficult societal challenges? Do you have skills that you want to teach others? Then write a blog post for us, speak at one of our Meetups, or teach a workshop. For details, please contact <a href="mailto:fabian@correlaid.nl">Fabian</a>.

### As an NGO
Are you part of an NGO that wants to use data science to operate more efficiently and effectively? Do you already have data and are looking for skilled analysts to get insights out of them? Or are you simply looking for somebody to brainstorm with about what is possible with data and data science? Regardless of what you need, we are happy to help! Please contact <a href="mailto:mehrzad@correlaid.nl">Mehrzad</a> to schedule a call.
