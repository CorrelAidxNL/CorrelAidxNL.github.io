## Ongoing Projects

## Past Projects

### BankTrack

### Macheo
Macheo is a charity operating in Thika, Kenya, trying to help children in the urban slums and rural areas surrounding the city. Macheo does this by providing interventions to children or their parents which can range from providing school lunches to kids all the way to monetary help for parents to start a business. Their main tool of assessment is the Child Status Index, which they use to determine children’s needs as well as the effectiveness of Macheo’s interventions. The goals of this project were twofold: To understand and assess Macheo’s impact, and to help Macheo improve this impact in the future by using insights from the data to improve their efficiency and effectiveness.

### Simavi
Founded in 1925, Simavi encourages girls and women to claim their right to equality and basic needs, resulting in a physically, mentally, and socially healthier society for everyone. Their work is women-centred, rights-based, and builds lasting change. They start and facilitate projects over two broad programmes: water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). This project’s goal was to analyze baseline and midline surveys that measure the impact of their WASH programme in 3 different countries, specifically focusing on Gender Equality and Social Inclusion.

### SLK
SLK empowers individuals, businesses and organisations in leadership with the aim to cultivate innovative solutions to sustainability challenges. With the help of a local GIS expert, Faruk Foniqi (UN Habitat), SLK has uncovered the rate of deforestation (including illegal deforestation) in Kosovo. Faruk has used satellite imagery using a GIS model for his analysis and has even made a predictive analysis for future deforestation. The aim of this project was to use this data to influence an ongoing governmental draft on deforestation regulation strategy as well as empower Civil Society Organisations, NGOs, and activists to increase pressure on the government to act.
