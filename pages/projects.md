Below you can find a list of our past and ongoing projects with organizations that advance the social good. Feel free to [reach out to us](/getting-involved) if you think that we can be of help to your organization and want to schedule a first call, or if you are a data scientist and want to get your hands dirty solving real problems.

# Ongoing Projects

### CrowdFight
[CrowdFight](https://crowdfight.org/) is a non-profit organization dedicated to facilitating scientific collaborations — especially those that don’t emerge naturally — by finding the experts needed to complement research projects and documenting the credit due to every participant. Its mission is to promote the advancement of science, its contribution to society, and the well-being of scientists. As an NGO that started at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, and grew to over 45000 volunteers in just 2 years, they know how impactful the power of collaboration is, and what is needed in order to make it work on a global scale. The purpose of this project is to help improve the profiles of CrowdFight volunteers, and help classify the incoming requests based on their scientific domain. This is needed in order to better match these volunteers with incoming requests from those seeking help. 

### Doneer Effectief
[Doneer Effectief](https://doneereffectief.nl/en/home-en/) is part of the effective altruism movement. Their mission is to make it easy to donate to global effective organizations from within the Netherlands. Their website plays a key role in realizing this goal, but how effective is their website? In this project, we set up analytics monitoring for their website together with a dashboard to highlight the results. Already during the lifetime of the project, useful insights were gained about their referral traffic facilitating cross-sector comparisons,

### Justice and Peace
[Justice and Peace Netherlands](https://justiceandpeace.nl/en/) is a non-profit organization based in The Hague that is dedicated to defending and promoting respect for human rights and social justice, worldwide and in the Netherlands. They work to empower change on the local level for human rights, adapting to the needs of the present and future, and most importantly, through working together. The purpose of this project is to design and implement a data environment for the onboarding process of groups and newcomers that participate in Samen Hier. Samen Hier is scaling-up and needs a data environment for the onboarding of a larger number of groups. The design should bear in mind the subsequent data and the implementation should already achieve a tangible benefit to Justice and Peace Netherlands rather than just the potential for future benefits. It should also be usable and maintainable by non-specialists.


# Past Projects

### BankTrack
[BankTrack](https://www.banktrack.org/) is an international tracking and campaigning organisation targeting private sector commercial banks and the activities they finance. BankTrack’s mission is to stop banks from financing harmful business activities; to promote a banking sector that respects human rights and contributes to just societies and a healthy planet; and to support fellow civil society organisations in their engagement with banks. BankTrack keeps a database of [about 190 banks](https://www.banktrack.org/search#category=banks), listing, among other things, their basic information, policies, and dodgy deals. These bank profiles are currently updated manually. In this project, CorrelAid Netherlands built a tool that scours the websites of banks and notifies BankTrack whenever a bank has updated their policies. Automating this process will save BankTrack valuable time and help them act swiftly in a changing policy landscape.


### Macheo
[Macheo](https://macheo.ngo/) is a charity operating in Thika, Kenya, trying to help children in the urban slums and rural areas surrounding the city. Macheo does this by providing interventions to children or their parents which can range from providing school lunches to kids all the way to monetary help for parents to start a business. Their main tool of assessment is the Child Status Index, which they use to determine children’s needs as well as the effectiveness of Macheo’s interventions. The goals of this project were twofold: To understand and assess Macheo’s impact, and to help Macheo improve this impact in the future by using insights from the data to improve their efficiency and effectiveness.

### Simavi
Founded in 1925, [Simavi](https://simavi.nl/en) encourages girls and women to claim their right to equality and basic needs, resulting in a physically, mentally, and socially healthier society for everyone. Their work is women-centred, rights-based, and builds lasting change. They start and facilitate projects over two broad programmes: water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). This project’s goal was to analyze baseline and midline surveys that measure the impact of their WASH programme in 3 different countries, specifically focusing on Gender Equality and Social Inclusion.

### Sustainability Leadership Kosova
[Sustainability Leadership Kosova](https://www.slkosova.org/) (SLK) empowers individuals, businesses and organisations in leadership with the aim to cultivate innovative solutions to sustainability challenges. With the help of a local GIS expert, Faruk Foniqi (UN Habitat), SLK has uncovered the rate of deforestation (including illegal deforestation) in Kosovo. Faruk has used satellite imagery using a GIS model for his analysis and has even made a predictive analysis for future deforestation. The aim of this project was to use this data to influence an ongoing governmental draft on deforestation regulation strategy as well as empower Civil Society Organisations, NGOs, and activists to increase pressure on the government to act.
