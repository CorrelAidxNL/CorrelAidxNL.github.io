      <p>CorrelAid Netherlands is a nonprofit organization that connects data scientists with organizations that do good. 
        We have a network of over 300 data scientists in the Netherlands and over 1500 abroad that are eager to volunteer 
        their time and expertise to help nonprofits with their data challenges. We started in 2018 as the Dutch chapter of 
        <a href="https://correlaid.org/">CorrelAid</a>. In 2020, Andrew, Fabian, and Yiran <a href="/stichting-correlaid">
          officially founded</a> the Stichting CorrelAid Nederland.
        </p>
        
        <blockquote><p>Our core activity is to engage in 3-6 month long projects where a team of our data scientists works with an organization 
          pro bono. We have completed a number of <b><a href="/projects">projects</a></b> successfully since our inception. We also organize 
          <b><a href="/events">events</a></b> such as hackathons and meetups.</p></blockquote>
        <h1>Goals</h1> 
        <p>Our goals are three-fold:</p>
        <p> 1. To create a diverse community of data scientists in the Netherlands who want to use their skills to advance the social good. 
          We want to create a platform where collaborations can emerge organically, and where our volunteers can learn from each other and help each other.
        </p>
        <p> 2. To create impact by working with nonprofit organizations, utilizing the power of data and data science to further their societal contribution. 
          We are providing a high-quality volunteer data science workforce and aim to become a well-known part of the Dutch non-profit ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>3. To empower the nonprofit sector to work with their own data. Systematically relying on skilled volunteers for data challenges is 
          not sustainable. The projects give organizations a taste of what is possible with data and give us an opportunity to facilitate the 
          continuation of the organizationâ€™s data journey after the project is done.
        </p>
