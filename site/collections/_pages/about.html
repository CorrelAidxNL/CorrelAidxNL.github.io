      <p>CorrelAid Netherlands is a non-profit organization that connects data scientists with organizations that do good. 
        We have a network of over 300 data scientists in the Netherlands and over 1500 abroad that are eager to volunteer 
        their time and expertise to help non-profits with their data challenges. We started in 2018 as the Dutch chapter of 
        <a href="https://correlaid.org/">CorrelAid</a>. In 2020, Andrew, Fabian, and Yiran <a href="/blog/stichting-correlaid">
          officially founded</a> the Stichting CorrelAid Nederland.
        </p>
        
        <p>Our core activity is to engage in 3-6 month long projects where a team of our data scientists works with an organization 
          pro bono. We have completed a number of <b><a href="/projects">projects</a></b> successfully since our inception. We also organize 
          <b><a href="https://www.meetup.com/correlaid-netherlands/">events</a></b> such as hackathons and meetups.</p>
        <h1>Goals</h1> 
        <p>Our goals are three-fold:</p>
        <p> 1. To create impact by working with non-profit organizations, utilizing the power of data and data science to further their societal contribution. 
          We are providing a high-quality volunteer data science workforce and aim to become a well-known part of the Dutch non-profit ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>2. To empower the non-profit sector to work with their own data. Systematically relying on skilled volunteers for data challenges is 
          not sustainable. The projects give organizations a taste of what is possible with data and give us an opportunity to facilitate the 
          continuation of the organization’s data journey after the project is done.
        </p>
        <p> 3. To create a diverse community of data scientists in the Netherlands who want to use their skills to advance the social good. 
          We want to create a platform where collaborations can emerge organically, and where our volunteers can learn from each other and help each other.
        </p>

        <p>Mehrzad received his Masters in Artificial Intelligence back in the time when AI was not that common in The Netherlands.
          As part of the first groups of students who did a full AI study in the Netherlands, he joined the early adopters of AI
          and took the challenge of bringing practical AI to the endeavors of everyday life. He has currently taken the challenge of
          bringing the power of collaboration to the scientific world by building digital solutions based on AI and Data Science.
          Mehrzad joined CorrelAid with the goal of making this blue planet a better place for everyone, helping NGOs harness the power of Data
          and Data Science. With a strong passion for collaboration and people, Mehrzad's everyday reminder is: Live, Love, Explore,
          and challenge your excuses everyday! <br>Contact: <a href="mailto:mehrzad@correlaid.nl">mehrzad@correlaid.nl</a>,

          finance, management, consulting and, of course, data science. He is particularly keen on evidence-based decision making and
          how the right perspective and information can reduce complex problems to straightforward ones.

          community and help expand the reach of the organization.
