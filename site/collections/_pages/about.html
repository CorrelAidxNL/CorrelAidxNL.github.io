      <p>CorrelAid Netherlands is a non-profit organization that connects data scientists with organizations that do good. 
        We have a network of over 300 data scientists in the Netherlands and over 1500 abroad that are eager to volunteer 
        their time and expertise to help non-profits with their data challenges. We started in 2018 as the Dutch chapter of 
        <a href="https://correlaid.org/">CorrelAid</a>. In 2020, Andrew, Fabian, and Yiran <a href="/blog/stichting-correlaid">
          officially founded</a> the Stichting CorrelAid Nederland.
        </p>
        
        <p>Our core activity is to engage in 3-6 month long projects where a team of our data scientists works with an organization 
          pro bono. We have completed a number of <b><a href="/projects">projects</a></b> successfully since our inception. and have also organized
          events such as hackathons and meetups.</p>
        <h1>Goals</h1> 
        <p>Our goals are three-fold:</p>
        <p> 1. To create impact by working with non-profit organizations, utilizing the power of data and data science to further their societal contribution. 
          We are providing a high-quality volunteer data science workforce and aim to become a well-known part of the Dutch non-profit ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>2. To empower the non-profit sector to work with their own data. Systematically relying on skilled volunteers for data challenges is 
          not sustainable. The projects give organizations a taste of what is possible with data and give us an opportunity to facilitate the 
          continuation of the organization’s data journey after the project is done.
        </p>
        <p> 3. To create a diverse community of data scientists in the Netherlands who want to use their skills to advance the social good. 
          We want to create a platform where collaborations can emerge organically, and where our volunteers can learn from each other and help each other.
        </p>
