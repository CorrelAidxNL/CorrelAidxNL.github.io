        Most people who reach out to us are either from a non-profit organisation wishing to work with us
        or a data enthusiast wanting to join the community as a volunteer.
        If either of those cases fit you, please follow the instructions below.
        If you want to reach out to us for any other reason,
        you can contact us in general (see details <a href="/contact">here</a>)
        or individually (see Core Team details <a href="/about">here</a>).
      </p>
      <h1>As a volunteer</h1>
      <p>
        At its heart, CorrelAid Netherlands is a community of <i>data enthusiasts</i>,
        and we are always happy to have enthusiastic new volunteers.
        We use the phrase <i>data enthusiast</i>, rather than <i>data scientist</i>,
        deliberately to highlight that we welcome a range of people from data curious to machine learning engineer.
        If you are doubting whether you have sufficient experience, don't be shy and just get involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two ways to get involved with our community: as a volunteer on one of our projects or by joining our <i>crew</i> / <i>core team</i>.
        The first step for both is the same: <a href="https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/257414/78748110521631819/share">signing up to our mailing list</a>.
        This sign-up form (the same one that is linked to at the bottom of many of our webpages) adds you to the overall CorrelAid mailing list.
        Please make sure to tick the CorrelAidX Nederland/Netherlands check-list to also be added to our sublist.
        This means you will receive news of our latest projects in your inbox and have the opportunity to apply to volunteer on them.
        Typical projects run from 3-6 months with 3-5 people and give you the opportunity to apply your data science skills to real world problems and help NGOs to gain insight into their own data and act upon those insights.
        We often have a designated <i>trainee</i> spot on our projects to also give you the opportunity to learn and develop new skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        A further step after joining our mailing list is to also join our Slack workspace.
        This is recommended for all volunteers, and you sign up for it separately using <a href="https://forms.gle/vkoAH7uguJacF6WY7">this form</a>.
        Afterwards you will be contacted by a member of the crew to have an introductory call.
        This is also how you can become active in helping to run CorrelAid Netherlands and join the crew.
        The crew is involved in a wide range of activities, and we are always happy to have more people on-board to reach out to NGOs, organise events and improve our online content to just name a few.
      </p>
      <h1> As an NGO</h1>
      <p>
        Are you part of an NGO or other non-profit organisation that wants to use data science to operate more efficiently and effectively?
        Do you already have data and are looking for skilled analysts to get insights out of them?
        Or are you simply looking for somebody to brainstorm with you about what is possible with data and data science?
        Regardless of what you need, we are happy to help! Please contact <a href="mailto:mehrzad@correlaid.nl">Mehrzad</a> to schedule a call.
