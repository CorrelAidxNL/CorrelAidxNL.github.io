      <h1> As an NGO</h1>
      <p>
        Are you part of an NGO that wants to use data science to operate more efficiently and effectively? 
        Do you already have data and are looking for skilled analysts to get insights out of them? Or are you simply looking for somebody to brainstorm with you about what is possible with data and data science? 
        Regardless of what you need, we are happy to help! Please contact <a href="mailto:mehrzad@correlaid.nl">Mehrzad</a> to schedule a call.
