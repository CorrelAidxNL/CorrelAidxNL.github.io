Alexis got involved with CorrelAid as way to put his existing data (science) and management skills to a positive use.
He originally moved to the Netherlands for a PhD in Probability Theory and has since had a somewhat nomadic career encompassing energy,
finance, management, consulting and, of course, data science. He is particularly keen on evidence-based decision making and
how the right perspective and information can reduce complex problems to straightforward ones.
