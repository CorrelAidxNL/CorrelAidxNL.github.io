During his masters in Neuroscience, Andrew started up an NGO and tried to build an orphanage in Kenya.
Two years in, 
he failed and vowed to build up his skillset and network to try to do good again once he had more experience.
He has since then worked as a data scientist at Capgemini, United Wardrobe, 
and Utelly, specializing in NLP, Search, and Recommendation Systems.
After seeing how much more impact we can have with data, 
he’s switched from building orphanages to building models for good.
