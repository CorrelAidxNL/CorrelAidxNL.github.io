Mehrzad received his Masters in Artificial Intelligence back in the time when AI was not that common in The Netherlands.
As part of the first groups of students who did a full AI study in the Netherlands, he joined the early adopters of AI
and took the challenge of bringing practical AI to the endeavors of everyday life. He has currently taken the challenge of
bringing the power of collaboration to the scientific world by building digital solutions based on AI and Data Science.
Mehrzad joined CorrelAid with the goal of making this blue planet a better place for everyone, helping NGOs harness the power of Data
and Data Science. With a strong passion for collaboration and people, Mehrzad's everyday reminder is: Live, Love, Explore,
and challenge your excuses everyday!
