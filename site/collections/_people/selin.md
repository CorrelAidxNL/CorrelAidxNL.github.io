Selin joined CorrelAid Nederland because it brings two of her favorite things together: 
working with data, and volunteering for organization whose efforts advance social good. 
Selin did her bachelor's in psychology with a minor in business in Turkey where she is originally from.
She is currently working as a PhD researcher at the Institute of Psychology at Leiden University, 
where she investigates how people learn and make decisions under uncertainty by modelling human behavior 
and brain responses. 
While she was volunteering for non-profit organizations before the pandemic, 
after the start of the pandemic she decided to put her skills she gained 
through her research training to use as a volunteer. 
As a part of CorrelAid team, 
she aims to contribute to organizing events for the CorrelAid Nederland community 
and help expand the reach of the organization.
