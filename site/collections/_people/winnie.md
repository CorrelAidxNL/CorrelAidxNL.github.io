Winnie has been with CorrelAid as a volunteer for approximately 2 years.
After her Masters in financial econometrics she’s had a somewhat rocky journey but her love for data, 
models and analyses has always been a constant.
As a lover of all things data, programming and tech and wanting to contribute to a better world,
she tried to find an opportunity to help others using a quantitative approach. 
Sharing her love for data and tech, correlaid seemed like the perfect opportunity.
Winnie is currently working on integration of Salesforce and helping Anastasiia 
and Alexis with blog posts for our website and the structure of our website.
Having met wonderful people who are inclusive and kind during her time at CorrelAid,
Winnie cannot encourage people enough to join CorrelAid and hope many more people will sign up.
