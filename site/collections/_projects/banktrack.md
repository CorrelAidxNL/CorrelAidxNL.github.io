<a href="https://www.banktrack.org/">BankTrack</a> is an international tracking and campaigning organisation targeting private sector commercial banks and the activities they finance. BankTrackâ€™s mission is to stop banks from financing harmful business activities; to promote a banking sector that respects human rights and contributes to just societies and a healthy planet; and to support fellow civil society organisations in their engagement with banks. 

BankTrack keeps a database of [about 190 banks](https://www.banktrack.org/search#category=banks), listing, among other things, their basic information, policies, and dodgy deals. These bank profiles are currently updated manually. In this project, CorrelAid Netherlands built a tool that scours the websites of banks and notifies BankTrack whenever a bank has updated their policies. Automating this process will save BankTrack valuable time and help them act swiftly in a changing policy landscape.
