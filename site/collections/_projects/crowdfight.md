## Project Partner
[CrowdFight](https://crowdfight.org) is a non-profit organization dedicated to facilitating scientific collaborations — especially those that don’t emerge naturally — by finding the experts needed to complement research projects and documenting the credit due to every participant.

Its mission is to promote the advancement of science, its contribution to society, and the well-being of scientists. As an NGO that started at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, and grew to over 45,000 volunteers in just 2 years, they know how impactful the power of collaboration is, and what is needed in order to make it work on a global scale. 

## Goals
The purpose of this project was to help improve the profiles of CrowdFight volunteers, and help classify the incoming requests based on their scientific domain. This was needed in order to better match these volunteers with incoming requests from those seeking help.

## Results
Over a six-month period, 
we set up an automated data pipeline running in Google Cloud to upgrade a process previously run via Google Sheets.
The pipeline pre-processes and saves all incoming Crowdfight data to Google BigQuery.
This set-up includes a data analysis notebook for assessing matching performance 
together with an ML ready training data set.

## Participants
The project was completed in two phases, with our project teams consisting of the following people:
- Phase 1: Mathis Lucka, Lada Rudnitckaia, Chiel Bakkeren, Julia Masloh and Mehrzad Karami.
- Phase 2: Mary Newhauser (Lead Data Science team), Martin Baldenhofer (Lead Data Engineering), Barnaby Rumbold, 
  Daljit Singh, Jaime Raldua Veuthey, Julian Werner, Sam Chien and Mehrzad Karami.

On Crowdfight's side, we were working with Alfonso Pérez Escudero and Francisco Romero Ferrero.
