CrowdFight is a non-profit organization dedicated to facilitating scientific collaborations — especially those that don’t emerge naturally — by finding the experts needed to complement research projects and documenting the credit due to every participant.

Its mission is to promote the advancement of science, its contribution to society, and the well-being of scientists. As an NGO that started at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, and grew to over 45000 volunteers in just 2 years, they know how impactful the power of collaboration is, and what is needed in order to make it work on a global scale.

The purpose of this project is to help improve the profiles of CrowdFight volunteers, and help classify the incoming requests based on their scientific domain. This is needed in order to better match these volunteers with incoming requests from those seeking help.
