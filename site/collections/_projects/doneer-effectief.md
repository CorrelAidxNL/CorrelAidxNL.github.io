[Doneer Effectief](https://doneereffectief.nl/en/home-en/) is part of the effective altruism movement. Their mission is to make it easy to donate to global effective organizations from within the Netherlands.

Their website plays a key role in realizing this goal, but how effective is their website? In this project, we set up analytics monitoring for their website together with a dashboard to highlight the results. Already during the lifetime of the project, useful insights were gained about their referral traffic facilitating cross-sector comparisons.
