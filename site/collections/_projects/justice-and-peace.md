<a href="https://justiceandpeace.nl/en/">Justice and Peace Netherlands</a> is a non-profit organization based in The Hague that is dedicated to defending and promoting respect for human rights and social justice, worldwide and in the Netherlands. They work to empower change on the local level for human rights, adapting to the needs of the present and future, and most importantly, through working together.

The purpose of this project is to design and implement a data environment for the onboarding process of groups and newcomers that participate in Samen Hier. Samen Hier is scaling-up and needs a data environment for the onboarding of a larger number of groups.

The design should bear in mind the subsequent data and the implementation should already achieve a tangible benefit to Justice and Peace Netherlands rather than just the potential for future benefits. It should also be usable and maintainable by non-specialists.
