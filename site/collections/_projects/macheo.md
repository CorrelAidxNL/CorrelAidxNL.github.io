<a href="https://macheo.ngo/">Macheo</a> is a charity operating in Thika, Kenya, trying to help children in the urban slums and rural areas surrounding the city. Macheo does this by providing interventions to children or their parents which can range from providing school lunches to kids all the way to monetary help for parents to start a business. 

Their main tool of assessment is the Child Status Index, which they use to determine children’s needs as well as the effectiveness of Macheo’s interventions. The goals of this project were twofold: To understand and assess Macheo’s impact, and to help Macheo improve this impact in the future by using insights from the data to improve their efficiency and effectiveness.
