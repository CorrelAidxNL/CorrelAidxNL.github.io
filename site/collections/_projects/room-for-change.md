# The Challenge
[ROOM FOR CHANGE](https://www.roomforchange.world/) by [The Present Movement](https://www.thepresentmovement.org/) offers temporary housing to economically homeless individuals through a partnership with hotels. The initiative provides one to five rooms per hotel (or 1% of total occupancy) to help those in need. It aims to shift participants from surviving to thriving by focusing on prevention, stability, permanent housing, and employment. Since 2021, over 120 people have begun rebuilding their lives with this program.

However, effectively monitoring and understanding the project's progress is a challenge. Insights into the number of individuals who have benefited from the project and the timeline it took for them to transition into lasting housing solutions could aid in attracting new hotel partners and fundraisers. This requires a comprehensive, easy to maintain data tracking system and reporting. 

# The Solution
With guidance and insights from the team at ROOM FOR CHANGE, our volunteers focused on automating ROOM FOR CHANGEâ€™s data management processes, from streamlining data capture to cleansing historical records and developing automated reporting mechanisms. As a result, ROOM FOR CHANGE now benefits from a unified and centralised data management system, better positioning the organisation to support more economically homeless individuals in the forthcoming year.

# The Impact
The impact was measurable: from 2022 to 2023 the number of participants who have been given a roof over their heads has increased by a significant 20%.  The transition to the automated system means ROOM FOR CHANGE can now allocate more time to make impactful decisions and focus on expansion, ultimately amplifying its contribution to society. 


> Getting support from CorrelAid was extremely valuable: we learned a lot and now finally have a system in which we can collect our data and get insights in our work. We are very grateful for the support of CorrelAid!
