Founded in 1925, <a href="https://simavi.nl/en">Simavi</a> encourages girls and women to claim their right to equality and basic needs, resulting in a physically, mentally, and socially healthier society for everyone. Their work is women-centred, rights-based, and builds lasting change.

They start and facilitate projects over two broad programmes: water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). This projectâ€™s goal was to analyze baseline and midline surveys that measure the impact of their WASH programme in 3 different countries, specifically focusing on Gender Equality and Social Inclusion.
