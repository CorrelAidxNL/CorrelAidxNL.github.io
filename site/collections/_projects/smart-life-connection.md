# The Partner Organsation
Smart Lifestyle Connection (SLC) is a foundation which aims to help the socioeconomic and cultural development of Curaçao, Suriname, Aruba and Sint-Maarten. 

In 2020, SLC was involved in the Quick Analyzed Data project on Food Security in the Caribbean Part of the Kingdom. The corona pandemic and lockdowns paralyzed the tourism industry on the islands, causing huge job losses, which in turn caused a shortage of food. With the report, SLC was successful in securing emergency food aid for the islands.

# The Challenge
A year later, in 2021, another large food shortage was expected, this time in Suriname. Assistance had been requested, including from the IMF, but was expcted to only come through in six months or more. Help was needed sooner than that. 

It was of crucial importance to convince emergency aid institutions in the Netherlands and EU of the severity and urgency of the issue, and ask for their support in providing  emergency food aid. In order to make a strong case, SLC would conduct interviews with people from key organizations in Suriname over the next few weeks, such as farming cooperatives, parliamentarians, the Emergency Committee at the ministry of Agriculture, UN representatives in Suriname, and NGO fieldworkers. 

However, in addition to qualitative reporting, SLC needed data to back up their claims. For this purpose, SLC reached out to CorrelAid.

# The Solution
In order to support SLC's call for help, our volunteers needed to find, analyze and visualize data on food security in Suriname -- as fast as possible. In 10 weeks, the volunteers gathered and combined data on food production, imports and exports, poverty, smallholder/subsitence farming, access to food and transport, and other factors that could contribute to food insecurity. 

# The Impact
The data gathering and analysis efforts led to several key findings on food insecurity in Suriname, as well as estimations on the required food support needs. These findings were summarized and visualized in the Hunger Risk Mapping Report.

Thanks to the combined qualitative and quantitative findings from SLC’s Quick Analyzed Data Project and CorrelAid Netherlands’ Hunger Risk Mapping Report, SLC was successful in securing emergency food aid for the islands.
