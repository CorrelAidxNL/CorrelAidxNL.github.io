# The Partner Organsation
[Sustainability Leadership Kosova (SLK)](https://www.slkosova.org/) is a non-profit organization dedicated to empowering individuals, businesses, and organizations to lead and integrate sustainability solutions in Kosovo. Founded in 2019 by Indira Kartallozi and a group of passionate collaborators, SLK aims to drive system change across the economy, people, and nature to create a sustainable, healthy, fair, and prosperous society.

# The Challenge
One the focuses of SLK is addressing deforestation in Kosovo. With the assistance of local GIS expert Faruk Foniqi, SLK identified the rate of deforestation, including illegal activities, using satellite imagery and GIS analysis. This data aimed to influence governmental draft regulations on deforestation and empower Civil Society Organisations, NGOs, and activists to pressure the government for action.

Despite having the story and the initial data, SLK faced a challenge in effectively presenting this information to raise awareness. Therefore an innovative way of designing and implementing a clear, impactful story that would captivate audiences and drive action was needed. 

# The Solution
With the guidance and insights from the team of SLK, the expertise in the storytelling of Ashraf Ramzy from MasterStory, and the dedication of CorrelAid volunteers, the combined efforts were focused on transforming the narrative around deforestation in Kosovo. Our volunteers combined data analysis with innovative data visualization techniques to create a compelling and persuasive story. This comprehensive approach turned raw data into meaningful insights and interactive maps showing sights of illegal deforestation throughout the years. Through this collaboration, SLK, CorrelAidNL, and MasterStory volunteers worked together to breathe life into the data, making it relevant and impactful.

# The Impact
The impact was significant: the findings were presented to the new environmental minister and compelled governmental action to address deforestation in Kosovo. By presenting data in an accessible and visually engaging manner, our volunteers successfully raised public awareness about the urgency of the deforestation crisis. The [#MoseMerrMalin](https://www.slkosova.org/mosemerrmalin) campaign, born from this collaboration, encouraged citizens, businesses, and the government to protect and restore Kosovo's forests. This initiative aims to grow the economy, secure jobs, ensure clean air, and foster a thriving natural environment, encouraging collective responsibility and decisive action.

> I personally think we have gained confidence to dream and create more ambitious actions.
