<a href="https://www.slkosova.org/">Sustainability Leadership Kosova</a> (SLK) empowers individuals, businesses and organisations in leadership with the aim to cultivate innovative solutions to sustainability challenges. With the help of a local GIS expert, Faruk Foniqi (UN Habitat), SLK has uncovered the rate of deforestation (including illegal deforestation) in Kosovo

Faruk has used satellite imagery using a GIS model for his analysis and has even made a predictive analysis for future deforestation. The aim of this project was to use this data to influence an ongoing governmental draft on deforestation regulation strategy as well as empower Civil Society Organisations, NGOs, and activists to increase pressure on the government to act.

There is a now a new blogpost with more details. Find out more about this project [here]({% post_url 2023-06-22-sustainability-leadership-kosova %})
